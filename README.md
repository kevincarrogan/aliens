# Alien invastion

## How to run

To run use the following command

    cat mapfile | python app.py alien_count

## Assumptions
All aliens move at the same time on each step, i.e. more than one alien can end up in a city at a time and thus all aliens will fight and destroy the city and each other at the same time.
